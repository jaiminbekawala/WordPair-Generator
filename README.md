# wordpair_generator

A new Flutter project. Generates an endless list of wordpairs. I also added a favorite button and a different drawer page which will save those favorited words.

## Getting Started
This project was my second of the many Flutter applications I've built and gained an understanding of how building an application is a puzzle of peices which you have to make them fit together and work flawlessly.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
